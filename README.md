## My Contributions (Yeonha Kim)

I focused on the scene/UI layer, ranking system, and overall polish, as well as narrative and art assets.

- Creative (Story / Illustration / Music)
  - Wrote and organized the original story to fit scene-by-scene progression
  - Produced/edited illustrations and integrated them into the scene UI
  - Curated music/sound assets (some copyrighted resources were used strictly for educational, non-commercial purposes)

- Scene / UI
  - Implemented story scene flow (dialogue + illustration layout) and menu-driven navigation
  - Implemented scene transitions based on user input (e.g., next/back/skip as available in the project)
  - Improved readability and pacing through layout and UI adjustments

- Ranking system
  - Implemented a local leaderboard UI
  - Implemented score persistence using LocalStorage (save/load)
  - Implemented sorting (descending) and basic input handling for player names (e.g., empty/length constraints as applied)

- Polish / UX
  - Refined user flow and reduced friction across menus and scenes
  - Performed bug fixes and gameplay/UX stabilization tasks
